# Pacman-Game
Classic pacman game developed from scratch with my own logic and strucutre, written with Phaser and Typescript.


# Structure
Created 3 main Classes:
##Map

##Tile

##Pacman

# Development
Started with the creation of the 3 main classes, gave them getters and setters and created the main structure of the map based in an 2D array, where each position represents a Tile of the game.
